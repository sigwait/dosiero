## Dosiero project

Dosiero is a web application that enables anyone to host their own files and sell it through Monero. Thought with privacy-first principles, Dosiero is the application you need to start selling your own assets (even for NTFs) in exchange of Monero.

### Why Monero?

There should be no introduction with Monero. Still the questions we daily receive from strangers about Monero. Here is it a little introduction to Monero:

* **real** privacy: Bitcoin, and other transparent-based blockchains do not protect your privacy at all. A market must be based on privacy, otherwise the players (as known as "who upload their assets") would play unfair with prices by checking all other merchant addresses. Monero employs different approaches to protect your financial data.
* **mature** project: no need to wake up Daddy1999, a stranger met on Discord during a wild night, to explain how to set up your own node. Monero is widely supported and if you are not sure about its nature, we would link you the first point: real privacy. To be stable, a market needs to find its roots on a mature and well-maintained project, such as Monero.
* **secure**: naturally. No explaination here.
* **great** community: a market can not exist without a community. Our current goal is to promote Dosiero with community.
